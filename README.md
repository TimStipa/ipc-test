# ipc-test
This is a test repo for verifying the behavior of IPC mechanisms (both on linux hosts and in a k8s cluster).

It includes source code for example producer/consumers of Unix domain sockets, as well as dockerfiles for producing container images.

Example clients are controlled in their respective directories:
* c
* python
